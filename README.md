Note: You will need to do the following before it being able to run. First you will need to scroll down to the source files "cAsteroid.cpp" and "cBullet.cpp" and in the relative path, you will need to delete "..\..\GP1 - Submission\Race The Rabbit\" so in the box it is only left with the name of the source file. Next, once you build the solution it will then prompt you up with the missing .dll files. From here copy all the dll files, add existing items then paste them into the first debug then cancel step. After this I hope that it will run smoothly.
